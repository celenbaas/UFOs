# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The goal of this project was to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to explore data around UFO sightings. To do this a webpage was built to allow users to view the data using HTML and second a dynamic table was created to present the data using JavaScript. As users update the filters the webpage dynamically updates the table.

## Results
The webpage allows users to filter the results by Date, City, State, Country and Shape to quickly explore what they want.  The directions below will help you explore using the filter search located on the left of the webpage.

1.	Locate the ‘Filter Search’ section on the left.

2.	Choose any one or all Filter elements of Date, City, State, Country or Shape to explore.  Please note ALL entered filter data needs to be lower case.  For Example State of CA returns 0 results, whereas ca brings back multiple UFO sightings.

3.	To apply the Filter element criteria hit Tab on your keyboard or click out of the box.

Here are a couple of examples, feel free to try these and explore others!

## Summary
### Drawback
This webpage is an awesome tool to allow readers to explore data around UFO sightings.  One drawback to this design if the data source requires a manual update.

### Recommendations for further development
If users are using the webpage to explore UFO data future enhancements I would recommend considering are:
1.	Re-working the data and creating an automated design that has a live connection or nightly run to ensure users get the most up to date facts.
2.	Working on the filters to eliminate them from being case sensitive.  For example, if I enter a state of CA, no data is returned as the user needs to enter ca.
